# SECR1013 DIGITAL LOGIC ðŸ’»
Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. 
This course introduces the students to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts to programmable logic devices. 
Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.

# Lab Assessment
In the first lab session, we learned about the pin layout for different types of Integrated Circuit. We also did experiment by manipulating input using ETS-5000 Digital Training Kit.<br>
