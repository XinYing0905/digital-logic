# SECR1013 DIGITAL LOGIC 💻
Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. 
This course introduces the students to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts to programmable logic devices. 
Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.

# Lab Assessment 👩‍🔧
1️⃣ In the first lab session, we learned about the pin layout for different types of Integrated Circuit. We also did experiment by manipulating input using ETS-5000 Digital Training Kit.<br><br>

- 💭 Reflection:
> The hands-on experience using ETS-5000 Kit has successfully bridge the gap between theory and real-life. It was a completely different feeling when you got to see how the output varies with input using bare eyes.
<br>
2️⃣ The second lab assessment required us to utilize DEEDS software, to perform multiple functions like demonstrating the output that varies with different input values and generating timing diagram. <br><br>

- 💭 Reflection:
> After this lab assessment, I was able to utilize DEEDS software. DEEDS software is a powerful tool for us to verify our circuits. It helps me saves a lot of time, as manually draw and verify the circuit is very inconvenient and time consuming.

3️⃣ The third lab havent done. Please be patient :><br>
